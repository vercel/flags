**BREAKING CHANGES** The general purpose `encrypt` and `decrypt` functions were replaced by dedicated functions, and it is now required to return version information from the flags discovery endpoint. See the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/vercel/flags/blob/main/packages/flags/guides/upgrade-to-v4.md) for upgrade instructions.
