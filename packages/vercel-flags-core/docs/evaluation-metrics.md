# Evaluation metrics

To associate evaluation metrics with an environment, pass the
`metricEnvironment` option:

```ts
const client = createClient(process.env.FLAGS!, {
  metricEnvironment: 'preview',
});
```

This option is sent only to the metrics ingestion endpoint. It does not select
the environment used for flag evaluation.
