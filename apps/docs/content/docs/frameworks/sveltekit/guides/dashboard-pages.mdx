title: Dashboard Pages
description: Use feature flags on dynamic pages.
---


Dashboard pages are rendered at request time, and may require authenticated
users.

The example below shows how to use feature flags to show a feature to
specific users on a dashboard page. They are flagged in based a specific cookie. The buttons below allow you to either act as a flagged in user
or as a regular user.

## Definition

The example above works by first defining a feature flag.

```ts title="src/lib/flags.ts"
import { flag } from 'flags/sveltekit';

export const showNewDashboard = flag<boolean>({
  key: 'showNewDashboard',
  decide({ cookies }) {
    return cookies.get('showNewDashboard')?.value === 'true';
  },
});
```

The example reads the value directly from the cookie. In a real
dashboard you would likely read a signed JWT instead.

## Usage

Any server `load` functions can evaluate the feature flag by calling it.

```ts title="src/routes/+page.server.ts"
import type { PageServerLoad } from './$types';
import { showNewDashboard } from '$lib/flags';

export const load: PageServerLoad = async () => {
  const dashboard = await showNewDashboard();

  return {
    title: dashboard ? 'New Dashboard' : `Old Dashboard`,
  };
};
```

Since dashboard pages are typically dynamic anyhow the async call to
evaluate the feature flag should fit right in.

## Evaluation Context

Feature Flags used on dashboards will usually run in the Serverless
Function Region, close to the database. This means it is acceptable for
a feature flag's `decide` function to read the database
when establishing the evaluation context. However, ideally, it would
only read from the JWT as this will lead to lower overall latency.
