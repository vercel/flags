description: Combine your feature flag provider with the Flags SDK using an adapter.
---

Integrate any feature flag provider with the Flags SDK
using an adapter. We publish adapters for the most common providers, but
it is also possible to write a [custom adapter](/providers/custom-adapters) in case we don't list
your provider or in case you have an in-house solution for feature flags.

## Featured Providers

Featured providers offer fast setup using [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace/category/experimentation),
and low latency with Edge Config. They also work well outside of Vercel in Next.js and SvelteKit projects.

## Additional Providers

Additional providers are published under the `@flags-sdk` npm scope in the [Flags SDK repository](https://github.com/vercel/flags) and offer different levels of
integration with Next.js, SvelteKit, and Edge Config.
